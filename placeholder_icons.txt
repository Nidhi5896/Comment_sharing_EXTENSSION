ICON CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

You need to create three icon files for the Chrome extension:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Place these files in the 'images' directory.

Suggested icon design:
- A speech bubble or comment icon with a share/link symbol
- Blue color theme (#1a73e8) matching the share button style
- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes

You can use any image editing software like:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Figma
- Canva
- Or use an icon generator service

Once created, place them in the images directory with the exact filenames mentioned above.
